# Material Theme for Sublime Text 3
This is the source code of Material Theme, the most epic theme for Sublime Text 3.


## Important
This is a beta version and if you use it, somewhere in the world, a developer will die.

## Manual Installation (for testing)

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme/releases/latest), extract and rename the folder in "material-theme".

2. Move the folder inside your sublime Packages directory.

3. Activate the theme with the following preferences:

```json
{
	"theme": "Material-Theme.sublime-theme",
	"color_scheme": "Packages/material-theme/schemes/Material-Theme.tmTheme",
}
```
